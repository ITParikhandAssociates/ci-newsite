<p><strong>Limited Liability Partnerships</strong> are normally called with their abbreviated form as <strong>LLP&rsquo;s</strong>. It is a fusion structure between a partnership firm &amp; a private limited company. In LLP&rsquo;s business is carried out in a corporate framework as per the mutually accepted partnership deed. LLP&rsquo;s are preferred when the partners are members of an institute or individual earnings are clearly defined, and distributed by dividend. Within an LLP the earnings of the members is normally seen as personal income.</p>

<h3>Benefits of an LLP</h3>

<p>The liability of partners is limited in case of an LLP whereas, partners are personally liable for debts of the business in a general partnership firm and even their personal property may be used to settle the firm&rsquo;s debts. Under LLP structure, partners are not responsible for negligence or misconduct of other partners, so there is protection against wrong doings of other partners in LLPs.</p>

<p><strong>Here are numerous benefits: </strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Great flexibility in business management as the operation of the partnership and distribution of profits are determined with the written agreement between the members.</li>
	<li>One can operate the LLP with different levels of membership.</li>
	<li>In LLP a member, can rent, lease, or buy, own property he can employ person or team, enter into contracts, and be held accountable if necessary.</li>
	<li>LLP&rsquo;s are a separate legal entity to the members and protect member&rsquo;s personal assets from the liabilities of the business.</li>
	<li>He can prevent another partnership or company from registering the same name by registering the LLP.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disadvantages of an LLP</h3>

<p>In some cases, it may disadvantageous.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Main disadvantage of LLPs is the Public disclosure. For the public record, the financial accounts have to be submitted and the accounts may affirm income of the members.</li>
	<li>No flexibility to hold over profit to a future tax year, all earned profit is proficiently distributed and profit can&rsquo;t be fetch as it is in the company limited by shares.</li>
	<li>If one member chooses to leave the partnership, the LLP will be dissolved, as an LLP require at least two members. <strong> </strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How the Income Tax Act applied to LLPs?</strong></p>

<p>Both general partnerships and LLPs are taxed at flat rate of 30% like partnership firms. All the other income tax act provisions are applied likewise except that general partnership firms are covered under presumptive taxation scheme.</p>

<p><strong>What is the minimum capital requirement for LLPs?</strong></p>

<p>There is no minimum capital requirement; LLPs can be registered even with Rs. 100 as total capital contribution.</p>

<p><strong>Is there audit requirement for LLP?</strong></p>

<p>If the turnover is Rs. 40 lakh or more or when the total capital contribution is Rs. 25 lakh or more, accounts of an LLP are needed to be audited.</p>

The span for a risk assessment matrix differs extensively. The exercise may recognize risks at the business process, enterprise, or individual project level.</p>

<p>Different risks, at both levels, process level and financial statement level evaluate together with the controls relevant against the same, can be documented in the form of a RCM. It is a complete document, which captures at one place, for each business cycle.</p>

<p><strong>Here are several points to be discussed.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The risks of material misstatement including the fraud risks and any other noteworthy risks that must be individually identified.</li>
	<li>The account balances affected against each of the risks recognized.</li>
	<li>The financial statement declaration that are made for each of the listed risks and accounts balances.</li>
	<li>The controls that are related to the each of the risks and assertions. A control may address more than one risk or assertion.</li>
	<li>The promptness of the control.</li>
	<li>Testing and reporting on the control and the document(s) that need to be prepared to evidence the exercise of the control.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Here are the illustrative formats of the Risk control matrix that shows the way of work we employ:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Risk (what may go wrong?)</li>
	<li>Account balances affected</li>
	<li>Manual/Automated control</li>
	<li>Control type preventive/detective</li>
	<li>Explanation of control activity</li>
</ul>

<p>It should also address the liability, regularity, and documentary evidence. The frequency is needed to shown them separately.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here are some of the general business cycles for which the separate RCMs could be prepared depending upon the nature of the business of entity and the materiality of the meticulous process.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Monetary Closing and Reporting</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Payroll</li>
	<li>fixed assets and depreciation</li>
	<li>Cash and Bank</li>
	<li>Lending</li>
	<li>Borrowing</li>
	<li>Procure to Pay (Purchase /Expenses and Accounts Payables)</li>
	<li>Bill to collect (Revenue and Receivables)</li>
	<li>Treasury</li>
	<li>Taxation</li>
	<li>Deposits</li>
	<li>Derivatives</li>
</ul>

<p>Preparation of a RCM is nothing but the documentation method for the Internal Control Framework and help in reporting on the working efficiency of Internal Financial Controls.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The significant part is to understand the interaction between the business cycles and the related activities or processes and the account balances affecting the same, to the degree it affects the financial reporting. Finally, the RCM also assists to recognize controls which are relevant and not relevant.</p>

<p>When the preparation of the same is suggested by the management as a part of its evaluation of the design and operating effectiveness of the controls for Board Reporting, in terms of Section 134(5 (e)&nbsp; of the companies Act, 2013.</p>

<p>It can use the same to evaluate the operating effectiveness of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting. We put a system to sporadically test the efficiency of the noteworthy controls identified in the RCMs.</p>

<p>We support the enterprise in increasing and designing the risk control matrices and put into practice the controls to talk to the identified risks.</p>
